## Introduction

This repository contains a collection of resources about Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). The resources are organized into the following categories:

        1. Node Classification
        2. Link Prediction
        3. Graph Classification
        4. Graph Generation
        5. Graph Clustering (Community Detection)
        6. Graph Matching
        7. Graph Embedding
        8. Graph Visualization
        9. Graph Sampling


Also we talk about different types of GNNs,
        1. Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs)
        2. Graph Attention Networks (GATs)
        3. GraphSAGE
        4. Graph Isomorphism Networks (GINs)
        5. Graph U-Nets
        6. Graph Transformer Networks (GTNs)
        7. Graph Recurrent Networks (GRNs)
        8. Graph Variational Autoencoders (GVAEs)
        9. Graph Autoencoders (GAEs)v
        10. Graph Convolutional Matrix Completion (GC-MC)
