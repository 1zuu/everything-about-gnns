# **1. Community Detection**
- When analyzing different networks, it may be important to discover communities inside them. Community detection techniques are useful for social media algorithms to discover people with common interests and keep them tightly connected. Community detection can be used in machine learning to detect groups with similar properties and extract groups for various reasons

### **1.1 Graph Convolutional Clustering**
- This approach is not very practical for realistic use cases
- Need labeled dataset unless we define number of clusters
- The model is not very scalable. This would be a major problem for large graphs
